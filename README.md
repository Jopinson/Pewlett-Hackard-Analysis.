# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.
This analysis was used to find out how many people were retiring from the company in an upcoming “silver tsunami.” Pewlett-Hacked has almost 500,000 employees and mangement is worried we may lose to many special skilled employees to retirement so we have also been tasked with creating a mentorship eligibilty program to help sort out those leaving and where their skills can go. 
## The Analysis

- Of Pewlett-Hackard's some 500,000 employees over 41,000 are going to be retirement eligible.
- Most of the retiring employees are senior staff, team leads, and senior engineers. Even many of the regular staff has been here long enough that their presence is vital to the company.
- When they leave it could create a skill gap which would lead to bad products and a loss of revenue.

- My team has created a mentorship eligibilty script that has selected employees we believe would be the best canidates to take to the younger generation and train them up to replace them.
