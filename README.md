# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.
This analysis was used to find out how many people were retiring from the company in an upcoming “silver tsunami.” Pewlett-Hacked has almost 500,000 employees and mangement is worried we may lose to many special skilled employees to retirement so we have also been tasked with creating a mentorship eligibilty program to help sort out those leaving and where their skills can go. 
## The Analysis

- Of Pewlett-Hackard's some 500,000 employees over 41,000 are going to be retirement eligible.
- Most of the retiring employees are senior staff, team leads, and senior engineers. When they leave it could create a skill gap which would lead to bad products and a loss of revenue.
