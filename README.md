# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.
This analysis was used to find out how many people were retiring from the company in an upcoming “silver tsunami.” Pewlett-Hacked has almost 500,000 employees and mangement is worried we may lose to many special skilled employees to retirement so we have also been tasked with creating a mentorship eligibilty program to help sort out those leaving and where their skills can go. 
## The Analysis

- Of Pewlett-Hackard's some 500,000 employees over 41,000 are going to be retirement eligible.
- Most of the retiring employees are senior staff, team leads, and senior engineers. Even many of the regular staff has been here long enough that their presence is vital to the company.
- When they leave it could create a skill gap which would lead to bad products and a loss of revenue.

- My team has created a mentorship eligibilty script that has selected employees we believe would be the best canidates to take to the younger generation and train them up to replace them.
## Conclusion
There are over 41,000 employees that are retirement eligible, Pewlett-Hackard will be losing centuries of employment experience to the so called "silver tsunami." In response to that the mentorship program was born, and will continue to live on past the first "silver tsunami." There are only 1549 employees of the 41,000 that qualify for the program, most are already senior staff or team leads. I believe that is a good number and that the mentorship program will work if each employee is mentoring a small team of about ten employees. The mentors are given two tasks, one is to train the new group to replace them, the second is to create their own agendas, tasks, or guides to leave behind for future employees to start their trainning on immediately. In the long run, Pewlett-Hackard doesn't need to replace every single retired employee, as advances in technology make jobs easier and quicker, and combining that with the soon to be promoted mentorship employees they can easily exceed all their goals.
